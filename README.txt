ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE WORK HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED AS MENTIONED IN THE GUIDELINES OF WORD FILE THAT YOU PROVIDED ME. I HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT GUIDELINES AND FOLLOW EACH & EVERY STEP WHICH WAS IN THE GUIDELINES.
FIRST OF ALL I HAVE CREATED A PAGE NAMED INDEX.HTML START HTML TAG. INSIDE THIS TAG I HAVE DEFINED TWO SECTIONS,

i : HEAD SECTION
ii: BODY SECTION

IN THE HEAD SECTION I HAVE DEFINED 3 DIFFERENT TAGS.
	1  :  META TAG (THIS TAG DEFINES DATA ABOUT DATA, SET A CHARSET UTF-8 , DEFINE WEBSITE DESCRIPTION AND DEFINE NAME OF THE AUTHOR).
	2  :  TITLE TAG (THIS TAG DEFINES TITLE OF THE WEBSITE)
	3  :  LINK TAG (IN THE LINK I HAVE LINKED A FILE NAME STYLE.CSS WHCIH EXIST IN THE CSS FOLDER.

IN THE BODY SECTION I HAVE DEFINE SOME DIVISIONS WITH DIV TAG.
	=> FIRST DEFINE A CONTAINER WITH THE WIDTH OF 980 PIXELS. THIS CONTAINER REMAINS CONSTANT IN ALL THE PAGES WITH WIDTH OF 980 PIXELS WITH ALIGN CENTER USING 	   MARGIN: 0 AUTO; 
	=> THEN DEFINE A HEADER SECTION WHICH CONTAINS ONLY MY NAME. THIS HEADER SECTION REMAINS SAME IN ALL THE PAGES. YOU WILL SEE MY NAME IN THE HEADER SECTION OF 	           ALL THE PAGES.
	=> AFTER THE HEADER PORTION I HAVE DEFINE A NAVIGATION BAR WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE LINKS TO THE OTHER PAGES. NAVIGATION BAR REMAINS SAME IN ALL THE PAGES 	   BIO.HTML, CV.HTML AND CONTACT.HTML .
	=> THEN DEFINE THE CONTENT DIVISION WITH WIDTH: 690 PIXELS WHICH CONTAINS THE CONTENT AND THESE CONTENTS GETTING CHANGED FROM PAGE TO PAGE AND REST OF ALL THE 	   	   THINGS REMAINS CONSTANT THROUG OUT THE WEBSITE. JUST THE CONTENTS GETTING CHANGED AT EACH PAGE. 
	=> AFTER THE CONTENT PORTION I DEFINE A DIV NAMED IMAGEBAR WITH THE WIDTH OF 220 PIXELS. AND WHICH CONTAINS ONLY MY PROFILE IMAGE. THIS PROFILE IMAGE REMAINS 	  	   SAME IN ALL THE PAGES BIO.HTML , CV.HTML AND CONTACT.HTML . BECAUSE ALL THE PAGES HAVE THIS DIVISION WITH THE SAME WIDTH.
	=> THEN AT THE BOTTOM I HAVE DEFINE A FOOTER DIV. THE FOOTER HAS ONLY THE TEXT COPYRIGHT 2017, AND THIS FOOTER REMAINS SAME IN BIO.HTML, CV.HTML AND 	   	   CONTACT.HTML 

AFTER ALL I HAVE BUILD THE BIO.HTML PAGE AND FOLLOW ALL THESE STEPS. AND ASSIGN MY BIOGRAPHY TO THE CONTENT PORTION.

THEN I HAVE BUILD THE CV.HTML PAGE. IN THE CONTENTS PORTION OF THIS PAGE I HAVE ADDED SOME MORE TAGS WHICH INCLUDES 
	I	: A PARAGRAPH TAG. WHICH DEFINES MY CV OBJECTIVES.
	II	: DEFINE H3 TAG FOR THE SKILLS AND UL TAG FOR MENTIONING MY SKILLS.
